# NLP Projects

Welcome to my **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects** repository!  
This collection includes various text classification and analysis projects I‚Äôve built while exploring how machines interpret and understand language. Each project applies different NLP concepts ‚Äî from Bag of Words and Word2Vec to spaCy pre-trained models and transformer architectures.

## Overview

This repository brings together multiple **real-world NLP classification tasks**, including fake news detection, sentiment analysis, spam filtering, and product categorization.  
Through these projects, I experimented with tokenization, lemmatization, n-grams, TF‚ÄìIDF, and contextual embeddings to understand how different NLP techniques influence accuracy and model behavior.

## My Learning Journey

Each project in this repository represents a step forward in understanding how NLP can be applied to **real-world problems** ‚Äî from identifying misinformation to classifying emotions and automating text categorization.  
Through experimentation and iteration, I learned how feature engineering, model selection, and embeddings influence NLP model performance.
